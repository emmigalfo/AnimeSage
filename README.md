## Project Overview
Anime Sage navigates through the extensive anime universe to deliver tailored recommendations to users. Utilizing data from My Anime List, the project developed a recommendation system that aligns with user preferences by employing an SVD model, achieving an RMSE of 1.16. The system is complemented by a user interface, enabling users to rate anime and receive immediate recommendations. While the current model effectively guides users to suitable anime titles, future iterations aim to explore hybrid models to further refine and personalize recommendations. Anime Sage strives to enhance user experience in anime exploration by continually evolving in its recommendation approach.
## Business Problem
There has been a surge in anime's popularity, not only in Japan but globally. Anime is becoming more promenent in consumer culture for both children and adults[^1^].Given the escalating interest and consumption of anime, there is a burgeoning need for sophisticated recommendation systems to navigate through the expansive anime domain, ensuring users can efficiently discover content that aligns with their preferences and enhances their engagement with the medium[^2^].
This project, born from my own challenges to find useful anime recommendations, aims to simplify this journey by developing a precise recommendation system tailored to individual preferences. In the booming anime industry, this system serves dual purposes: guiding viewers to titles they'll love and providing streaming platforms with a tool to enhance user engagement and potentially increase revenue through personalized content suggestions. The goal is to enrich the anime discovery and viewing experience, creating a win-win scenario for both viewers and streaming platforms by facilitating more personalized and satisfying content exploration.
## Data Understanding
The recommendation system is built upon data derived from My Anime List, a well-known online platform that provides its users with a comprehensive database of anime, including user ratings, reviews, and recommendations. The datasets utilized for this project can be accessed and reviewed [here](https://github.com/Hernan4444/MyAnimeList-Database). The files used were the anime.csv and rating_complete.csv files within the data folder.

Anime Data (anime.csv): This dataset provides a detailed overview of various anime titles available on the platform. It encompasses numerous attributes such as anime ID, name, genre, type (e.g., TV, movie), episodes, rating, and members, among others.
User Ratings Data (rating_complete.csv): This dataset includes the user interaction with various anime titles, represented through user IDs, anime IDs, and the respective ratings assigned by the users
